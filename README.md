# Quickstart

This [template repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template) follows this IaSQL [tutorial](https://docs.iasql.com/quickstart/) to deploy a Node.js HTTP server within a docker container on your AWS account using ECS, ECR and ELB. The container image will be hosted as a public repository in ECR and deployed to ECS using Fargate.
